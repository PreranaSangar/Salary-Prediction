# Salary-Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a salary prediction system built using Linear Regression and deployed with Streamlit. Users can input details such as experience or relevant features, and the model predicts the expected salary.

📌 Project Description

This is a simple machine learning project where a **Linear Regression** model is trained to predict an individual's salary based on features like years of experience. It includes:

- Training a model with real or sample salary data.
- Saving the trained model using `pickle`.
- Building a web app with **Streamlit** to make predictions interactively.

1.Install Required Packages
  pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn

2.Train the Model (Optional)
  python "regression code .py"
  
3.Run the Web App
  streamlit run app.py

🔍 Features
